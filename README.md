StackToNearbyChests
===
A fork of the StackToNearbyChests mod, updated for the latest version of Stardew Valley

#### Our Changes

As per the terms of GPL 3.0, we have to state our changes. They are as follows
- Changed `using Harmony` to `using HarmonyLib` for the new Harmony version
- We use the specific `helper.ModContent` helper instead of `helper.Content`
- Updated the `icon.png` file to our own artwork, which better fits the game's style
- Updated the logic for finding nearby chests to account for changes to Stardew Valley
